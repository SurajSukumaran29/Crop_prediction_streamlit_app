Crop prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) involves using various environmental and agricultural data to predict the type of crop that will perform best in a given area. The KNN algorithm is used to classify or predict the crop type based on factors such as:

    Soil Type: Different crops require specific soil conditions (e.g., sandy, loamy, or clay soil).
    Temperature: Optimal temperature ranges for different crops.
    Humidity: Certain crops thrive in specific humidity levels.
    Rainfall: The amount of precipitation in the region, influencing crop growth.
    Farming Practices: Irrigation methods, crop rotation, or fertilizer use.
    Season: The time of year can impact which crops are suitable for planting.

By analyzing historical data of past crops, weather conditions, soil health, and other factors, KNN helps predict the best crop for a given area, improving agricultural yield and resource management. The algorithm classifies the crop type based on the proximity of current conditions to similar historical cases, making it a useful tool for precision agriculture.
